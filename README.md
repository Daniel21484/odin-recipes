# odin-recipes
Recipe project for The Odin Project

When I have completed this project I will have demonstrated the use of ordered lists, unordered lists, and relative links. 
I will have used a basic boilerplate for html sites and made a template for easy duplication of pages to speed up workflow.
I will also have demonstrated a basic understanding of git and its commands by pushing my changes to github with comments.
